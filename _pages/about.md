Xian Zhong is currently a Professor and Ph.D. Supervisor with the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Wuhan University of Technology (WHUT). He received Bachelor (’03–’07)degree in the School of Computer Science from Wuhan University (WHU), and Master (’07–’09)and Ph.D. (’09–’13) degrees in the School of Computer Science and Technology from HuazhongUniversity of Science and Technology (HUST). He served as a Visiting Scholar (’21–’22) with the School of Computer Science at Peking University (PKU) under the supervision of Prof. Tiejun Huang. Additionally, he is currently a Visiting Scholar (’23–Now) with the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) under the supervision of Prof.Alex Chichung Kot.
In the academic field, his research interests include multimedia analytics and intelligent transportation. He has led over ten projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China(NSFC) General Program. He has published more than 100 papers, with nearly 20 top tier papers(TIP, TMM, TCSVT, TITS, PR, CVPR, ACM MM, AAAI, IJCAI, etc.), and more than 10 granted Chinese invention patents.
He is an Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Senior Member of the China Computer Federation (CCF), Vice Chair of the CCF Youth Computer Science and Technology Forum (YOCSEF) Wuhan, Executive Member of the CCF Technical Committee on Multimedia Technology, Member of the China Society of Image and Graphics (CSIG) Technical Committee on Multimedia, Member of the CSIG Technical Committee on Traffic Video, and Board Member of the Wuhan Computer Software Engineering Society. He has served as invited reviewer for top journals (TIP, IJCV, TMM, TCSVT, TGRS, etc.), and session chair and PC member for top conferences (CVPR, ICASSP, ACM MM, AAAI, IJCAI, ACL, EMNLP, COLING, etc.), and been awarded Outstanding Reviewer Recognition by ICASSP ’23.
He served as a leading organizer of the Grand Challenge “Seeing Through the Rain (STRAIN): Vision Task Challenges in Real-world Rain Scenes” at ICME ’23, and a mentor for the PhD MentoringSessions at both ICME ’23 and ICIP ’23. He served as a guest editor for Multimedia Tools and Applications special issue on “Robust Enhancement, Understanding, and Assessment of Low-Quality Multimedia Data”, and for Applied Science special issue on “Recent Advances in Image Processing”. In the administrative field, he served as the Deputy Director (’22–’23) of the Information Office at WHUT, playing a key role in implementing data-driven business process reengineering and management optimization. Under his leadership, a Data Driven Management Center was established, introducing a governance model for important decision meetings known as “systematic reporting, data narration”. Additionally, the first AI Vice President’s Assistant was launched, utilizing AI to remind of task implementation progress and goal achievement, thereby enhancing governance
transparency.
